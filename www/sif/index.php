The SIF project is an innovation project being run by BBC World Service Transmission &amp; Distribution to investigate an entirely IP based routeing
system for audio and video. Given the realisation that the final output from our current systems is an IP stream, why not try to encode to IP at the
source and do away with linear routers and coding and multiplex systems? SIF is an experiment towards this goal.
<p>
The SIF project is being worked on by <a href="mailto:julian.cable@bbc.co.uk">Julian Cable</a>,

SIF was a Norwegian Goddess, some might say we have named the project after her as it stands for 'Spend Innovation Fund' but we couldn't possibly comment!
