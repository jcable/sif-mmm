Configuration for dnsmasq and pxelinux, as well as thoughts for root mounts.

= Details =

== dnsmasq ==

I initially used my home router and configured dnsmasq on it as follows:

dhcp-boot=pxelinux.0,,192.168.2.136

== pxelinux ==

On Debian unstable the tftpd-hpa package installs with defaults for the root directory in

/var/lib/tftpboot

The file /etc/default/tftpd-hpa needs to be edited and /etc/inetd.conf

I put the following in /var/lib/tftpboot:

initrd.img-2.6.26-1-486  memdisk  pxelinux.0  pxelinux.cfg  vmlinuz-2.6.26-1-486

pxelinux.cfg is a directory containing a default config.

All files have world read and all folders world execute.

= root partitions =

Possibilities:

* whole system in the initramfs
* root mounted over iSCSI
* root mounted over drbd
