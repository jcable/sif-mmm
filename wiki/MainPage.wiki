= Introduction =

sif-mmm is a project to investigate opportunities in open source broadcast production. We plan to build a working model of a sophisticated meta-data driven broadcast centre, initially radio based.

Novel features are:

 * Everything managed in a central database
 * all media moved over IP networks
 * No single point of failure

We current have the following sub-pages:

  * [SIF_Concept_Notes]
  * BiosSettings
  * [Booting]
  * [Discovery]
  * AlsaStuff
  * [VLC]
  * DataBaseSchema
